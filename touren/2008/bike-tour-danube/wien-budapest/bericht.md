## Klosterneuburg to Bratislava
  
### 24.05.2008 / 95km / AS 18km/h / T 5:04 / left to go: 1999km

this morning we had it a lot easier and by 9am we left in direction to Wien and Bratislava. it took more than an hour to pass through Wien. we cycled on the Prater, a cycle path thats 6m broad. after we left Wien we reached the March and Donauauen. in the little town Orth we took lunch next to the castle. just after we sat down a totally bizarre dude with a bear and a sandwich showed up and sat down at our table. he had an attention span of a shrew inclusively it movement pattern. he was jabbing on about a lot of things for example that he was training for astronaut application.

The road through Donauauen goes straight as an arrow for 14km but the landscape is tremendously beautiful. smooth meadows and fluffy forests. in Hainburg we ate up our last Euro (14) at an ice cream cafe. we both became completely hysterical when we saw Bratislava  at horizon.  we  past the border without even seeing a sign. now we are actually in Slovakia, true eastern state feeling. in Bratislava we decided to go to the camping, it was 7km without any map and on a heavy traficated road. poeple  looked strangely at us on our heavy loaded bikes.

## Bratislava (SK) to Györ (H)
  
### 25.05.2008 / 107km / AS 18.5km/h / T 5:45 / left to go: 1919km

in the morning we had to ride back to Bratislava on the worst car road we've ever seen. we wanted to visit the town, but everything was closed because it was Sunday morning. we got into a church but were promptly thrown out  by a grim janitor. on our way to the Hungarian border we met a group of cyclists who were training for a triathlon competition. we joined them. darn it went fast, we made an average speed of 30km/h for almost an hour. before we crossed the border we took a look at the dam and the reservoir Vodne Dielo Gabcikovo where 97.5% of the water from Duna (H)/Dunaj(SK) is led into a canal. rest goes as Mosoni Duna through Hungary. we follow this stream for a while in dirction of Györ (Djör). the way goes through a lot of small villages and even more fields. all the villages are called something with Duna... or Györ. there is only one cycle sign every 20km so we have to practice some advanced orientation through until we reach Györ.

in one of the villages (we thing it was Duasziget) we met a danish couple. we joined them for a while  and it seemed as if they didn't really know what they got them self into. (if you are reading this: pleas tell us how you reached Budapest!)

as we reached Györ there was a lot of life in the city. there was a children festival, a lot tourists and a tivolli in town. after some more advanced orientating we finally found the camping, which was situated next to the football arena where there was a match going on. total chaos. we had forgotten to take out some money so Nisse went out to find an ATM. Hannah was already fearing, that he never would come back. but to both our surprise Nisse "the magic man" was back within 15min - with 20 000 Huf (Hungarian Forint).

## Györ to Esztergom
  
### 26.05.2008 / 123km /AS 18.7km/h / T 6:34 /left to go: 1808.5km

the day started once again with orientation, so we came up with a new strategy. Hannah is reading the book and describes the route to Nisse who cycles in the front an d keeps an eye on the traffic. this works perfect, as long as the roads have not been rerouted and Nisse don't cycles faster than Hannah is reading. after some fields and villages it went on large car roads all the way to Komarom/Komarno, the Hungary/Slovakia border. on this day we saw two bicycle signs. we went on all kinds of roads: even asphalt, fields, motor cross cours, gravel, grass, cobblestone pavement etc.

In Komarom we had lunch lunch at an old star shaped fortes which still is guarded by dogs. shortly after Komarno we cycled on the bank. it was mostly grass and loose gravel on top. with even distances there were barriers we had to cycle over. it went well almost every time. one was loose like a swing so Hannah almost fell off her bike. In Radavan we took a bath in the Dunaj. it was very refreshing and it would have been wonderfull to stay but: kilometers, kilometers ... finally after 123km we reached Esztergom. finished.

## Esztergom to Budapest
  
### 27.05.2008 / 90km / AS 17.6km/h / T 5:08 / left to go: 1774.5km 

shortly after our trip to the Basilica in Esztergom we cycled on Dunas right shore and just after Tsz we took the ferry over to Szob. from Szob we cycled close to the Duna all the way to Vác. it was one of the most beutiful parts. the landscape is called "Danoube Knee" becuse here the Duna turns South. The river squeezes itself through the mountains and meanders back and forth. shortly after Visegrad it parts itself and creates a big island: Szentendrei Sziget. here the cycle paths are in a very good state and we saw also the first signs for a long time. probably also the last ones.

we ate at a restaurant in Vác. for a little change in our menue we ordered some meat and sallad. the waitress could only speak Hungarian and a few words of German and the menue was in Magyar. the waitress did not know what pork was in german so she ended up grunting like a pig. during the meal we got a little Magyar lesson and learnt some frases from her. we took the bote over to Szentendrei Sziget, this island is covered with strawberries so we bought some in the next town. a few kilometers later we bought some more from a beardy old lady. the problem was just, she had no change for our 1000 Huf (4 €) but her husband showed up in a car and he managed to scramble some change.

in Szigetmonostor we took another ferry over to Szentendrei. here we followed the B11 towrds Budapest. it was very hard to find the way in to the city and very much trafic but when we saw the parliament building the feeling was overwhelming us. we found a hostel for 13€ per person in the center of Pest. everything was perfect, we just had to carry up our bikes for 5 stories.

## Budapest
  
### 28.05.2008 / 0km / AS 0km/h / T 0:00 / left to go: 1774.5km

before lunch we visited Buda and saw the old Fisher Bastion, the castle and the churches. in thze castle we went to a Moholy-Nagy retrospective exhibition. it perfect thing to do becuse it was like 35°C outside and we were melting. we walked back to the hotel where we ate at least 2kg of pasta sallad. after lunch Nisse was resting whiles Hannah went to town shop for tires, reflecting wests etc. we had a plan to make another trip in Pest to look at some synagoges and train stations (no more churches) but when we came back from blogging our room mates had arrived. we skipped the sightseeing and had a darn nice time wtih them in the dormitory instead and we drank some bears.
