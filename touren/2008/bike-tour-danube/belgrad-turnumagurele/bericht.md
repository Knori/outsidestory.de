## Belgrad to Dubovac

  
### 05.06.2008 / 95km / AS 18.6km/h / T 5:05h / left to go: 1029km

Getting out of Belgrade wad a nightmare. tons of trucks and the traffic was chaotic. after the bridge over the Dunav (which was dangerous as hell) we chose to go on the river bank. it was fucking hard work, because the rain had made the "road" to a clay marsh. after 12km we where totally done and chose to take the car road instead. we went through villages and chemical industries. when we had the worst part behind us we stopped at a gas station to get our bikes cleaned. the owner spoke german and offered us coffe whiles we where waiting for our bikes to be cleaned. he told us about a 69 year old lady who was doing the tour by herself.

In Kovinwe had lunch by a small marina and when we head of thethunder started so we fled into a cafe. we ordered a coffee and waited for the rain to siece. when we wanted to pay the only reply we got was: 'it's on the house'. we went on and suddenly the landscape changed from fields to soft sand dunes. shortly after in Dubovac we started to search after somewere to sleep. jet again at least ten people where involved in the discussion. everyone wanted to help us ans was jabbing in Serbian. finally we got to follow a car to the hotel/shed where we met a Swiss couple which we had encountered shortly after Novi Sad. Nisse kept awake untill 11pm when the boss finally showed up. he told Nisse that should go to slep and pay in the morning instead.

## Dubovac to Kamp Toma

### 06.06.2008 / 80km / AS 16.6km/h / T 4:51h / left to go: 959.5km

Nisse didn't think that there would be a breakfast so we ate our Muesli in the room. but when we took a coffee in the restaurant we found out that a massive breakfast was included. we ate that one to and with full stomacs we cycled to the ferry over to Ram. on the other side we took a sandy road which was full of snakes and lizards. the surroundings where stunning. we didn't make much sped and by 1pm we reached Veliko Gradiste. we felt that we could ride a bit further before lunch so we just took a quick coffee.

We went in head wind and rain ands by Usije we got on road 25-1 which we would follow dor the next 100km. we cycled around the huge lake that is created by the dam "Iron Gate" far away in Sip. after some wind tunnels we got to the fortress Jerinin Grad where we ate a very late lunch. the fortress is halv covered with water because the Iron Gate has risen the water level with 35m. we didn't get much further because we stopped at the next camping. at the camping we met women from Finspång in Sweden. she fled from Serbia in the 70ies and we talked to her for a very long time.

## Kamp Toma to Golo Brdo

### 07.06.2008 / 70km / AS 18.4km/h / T 3:47h / left to go: 894.5km

on the days stage there where 21 unlit tunnels on the scedule. the road is carved out from the mountain side and there are rockslides everywere. most of the the villages that where drowned when the dam was built in the 60ies where rebuilt higher up on the slope. we went to a museum in Lepinski Vir were they have found a stone age village which was incredible well preserved. by luchtime we reached Donij Milanovac were we discovered that Hannahs rear brake was broken. with a lot of innivation and a nut from the spare brake we solved it. we ate a huge luch and to get our digestion started we ordered a small Jaegermeister but we got at least 8cl each.

still in the rain we headed of to the narrowedt place in the Dunav breakthrough trough the  Carpathians. when we got closer the landscape became more and more like something out of The Lord of The Rings. it was so beautiful that we had to stop everywere it was possible to enjoy the view. at the narrowest part of the Valley the river is only 150m wide but amazing 90m deep (the worlds deepest river). to the sound of chants from a monastary on the other side we went up on a unbelievably long uphill to Golo Brdo (at 277m.n.m. we decided to on a meadow and asked a shepherd if it was O.K. and he was wery happy that we wanted to camp there.

## Golo Brdo to Burila Mare

### 08.06.2008 / 75km / (bike computer broken) / left to go: 820km

In the morning we had very good speed down the mountain. we cycled all the way to the Iron Gate, the big hydroelectric plant, which is also the border between Serbia and Romania. the bordercrossing took some time but in the end they let us pass. the dam was not half as impressive as we had imagined. then onwards on a large car road to Drobeta-Turnu-Severin. there we tried to find a working ATM, we had to try four times. we sat down at an Internet cafe and finnaly got a chance to upload our pictures. at 10am we had past the border but it wasn't untill 4:30pm (including a time zone +1h) that we managed to get out of town.

after a few kilometers Hannahs bicycle computer died without any plausible reason. on wards in silence, Nisse kept himself as passive as possible and let Hannah cycle the worst anger out of her. but landscape was so beautiful and all the animals on the road where so funny, that her anger soon dissapered. we decided to cycle all the way to the end of the gravel road, because of the risk for rain. in the end we camped in an abandoned apple orchard. we fell asleep the moment we lay down. in the middle of the night a stray dog began to bark outside of the tent. Hannah was sleeping as a babe whiles Nisse was sitting in the tent shaking of fear, because he was convinced that dog had rabies. Nisse was awake for two hours, eating peanuts and smoking and thinking of ways to get rid of the dog.

## Burila Mare to Cetate

### 09.06.2008 / 76km / (still broken) / left to go: 746km

in the morning we realised that the dog was just a little yellow teddy bear. we cycled a number of villages that all looked the same, the only thing that differed them was the state of the road. Burila Mare, Tiganasi, Gogosu, Balta Verde, Izvoarele, Gruia, Pristol, Garla Mare, Vrata, Salcia and at last Cetate. In Gruia we took a coffee and the entired village seemed to gather around us. luckily an elder man showed up and kept the croud at bay. it is very hard to stop in a village without large hords of children gathering around us, so we ate our lunch in the fields. we didn't see many cars today, but a lot of horse carrieges loaded with all kinds of stuff, from branches to furniture. there are lose animals everywere. there are: pigs, geas, horses, cows, goats, children, sheep and a tons of stray dogs. the dogs seem to lack all urge of survival. they are sleeping in the middle of the road, not seeming to care about anything.

there is a lot of commotion in the village. everyone is on the way to somewere. they are walking up and down the main street seeming to have a certain goal in mind. but they all return in the opposit direction a few minutes later with the same expression in their face. we have no idea what they are up to but we are shore that it will make itself clear sometime in the near future. now we are sitting by the Dunarea (new name again) enjoying the final of the sunset. we are living in art coloni and have got laundry done. god how nice. Nisse has taken a crap. god how nice. and there are a group of Germans staying here which is getting on our nerves. hopefully we won't meet them again.

## Cetate to Zaval

### 10.06.2008 / 113km / (still broken...) / left to go: 639k

now we have to explain about the German 3 men, one more anoying than the other, and one poor woman who had to join them because it's not safe to travel alone. she is the only one who is nice. they left 45min before us, but we past them in the next village were they had braekfast. we visited an orthodox monestary which was being built. it was interesting seeing the paintings in verious stages of complition. when we left the Germans showed up, and the most anoying of them  refused to whear long legged throusers when he entered.

now throug villages and the countryside in tremendous speed. the germans passed us when we where grocery shopping and we hoped we would be ridd of them for good. after Calafat we passed through a 15km long village and then took a break in Rast. we went on all the way to Zaval. it is one long road crossing Romania and its full with horse carriages and alternating identical villages and fields (there is absolutely nothing spectacular here to see). we wanted to rent a cabin but they wanted 10 Euro for 6sqm without shower nor toilet. we decided to camp by the river istead close to a farming trail but we soon realised that it was a highly frequented rout to nowere. all the horses panicked when they past our tent. at the cabins we met Uwe and offered him to join us the next days.

## Zaval to Turnu Magurele

### 11.06.2008 / 95km / (it started to work again today :-) / left to go: 546km

when we woke up the was a thick morning fog over the entire landscape. we met up with Uwe by the cabins and road off. already in the next village we saw the Germans bicyles again. a short time later we encountered them again and got to know that their daygoal also was Turnu Magurele. we cycled like maniacs the whole day. now we where  three who could change riding in the front. a few kolometers before the center of Corabia we had our lunch at the old roman castel Sucidiva. after luch we went on through fields and past one milestone after the other. the heat was almost not bearable.

at the river Olt we took a bath. we left our bicycles at the bank within sight. the river was cool and refreshing and it runs very quickly. suddenly Uwe sees someone running away from his bike. when he looks after his backpack with his tent, sleeping bag and Termarest was stolen. this incident ruined the good mood, especially because there are parts without any hotels for about 150km.

In Turnu Magurele we where forced to take in on a very expensive hotel (it was the only one within 120km) it cost us 220 Lei (30 Euro). the rooms where nice but there was no warm water. we met two local girls in the park, Lilly showed us the town and where we could find somewhere to buy lunch for tomorrow. after supper (with the Germans at the next table again) we went went to an Internetcafe to blogg. it was extremly warm inside and a lot of mosquitos, so we didn't manage to wright very much.
