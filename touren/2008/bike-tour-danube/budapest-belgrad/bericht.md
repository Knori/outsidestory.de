## Budapest to Szalkszentmárton
  
### 29.05.2008 / 78km / AS 19.0km/h / T 4:06 / left to go: 1698km

the day started with Hannah thowing up her breakfast again. a little shaky we packed our things and searched liked maniacs after the diary that Nisse had had last time. he was even more nerveous than in passau where he had "lost"  his wallet. finaly we found tit in a secret compartment in Hannahs handelbar bag. Now the struggle of taking us out of Budapest started. Hannah road in the front. the only interaction was when Hannah was yelling at Nisse to stay behind her and just follow. against all odds we managed to take us out of the city without any car accidents.

we cycled south on big car roads and the river bank where the path was at a maximum 20cm broad. shortly after Tököl we met the first and only cyclists today, a swissgerman couple hwo was also cycling to the Black Sea. we joined them for a while but in Ráckeve we had to part again because they are going through Transylvania and will need a lot more time. before we parted we had a picnic lunch with them in a park in Ráckeve.

the following road was a lot more beautiful and lot less trafic. we left the island between Duna and Ráckevei Duna over a very small bridge. shortly after the bridge a sign for a camping showed in to the right. we followed it without realy believeing that there was a camping there. But we wre lucky, just around the corner some artificial lakes with a camping for only 800 Huf (3€) per person. we have our own little bay where we took a bath in the perefect water. cosy.

## Szalkszentmárton to Baja

### 30.05.2008 / 125km / AS 19.3km/h / T 6:31h / left to go: 1584km

in the morning we went for a swim in the lake with the sun rising in front of us. we started cxyckling but did not very far because we stopped al the time. in the first village to post some postcards, in the second to buy some food and in the third to visit an Interenet cafe. at 12 we had only made 25km and still some to do. shortly before Solt we crossed Duna on a bridge. the right side was very beautiful and we got rid of the B51, thet we had followed since Budapest, for a while. near Paks we had to ride on a very heavy trafficated way, almost a motorway, for a short while. with a ferry we came over to the left side again. here we met some filthy Netherlands.

we cycled again on the B51 through small villages and the burning sun. Nisse almost fainted of a heatstroke becaiuse he had drunk beer instead of water. finally in Kolosca we cooled down in a church and ate Birthday lunch/supper at a restaurant. it was alot of food and the sweetest dessert ever. this is the paprika center. on the road to the Duna-Dráva Nemzeti Park we came through a lot of paprika fields. had some fun singing paprika songs i.e. "we all live in yellow paprika...".

as we arrived at the camping, which was no camping, we looked for the camping which did not exist. on the map there were 10 campings between here and Baja. we looked for all of them on small foresttracks, at restaurants and everywere elso but none of them existed. we ended up cycling another 25km to Baja only to discover that the camping there had shut down. to our luck there was a "hotel" that mostly reminded of a Stasi prison were we got a room. the room where nice and clean but the bathroom was reminding of "Eastern Promises".

## Baja to Batina

### 31.05.2008 / 82km / AS 18.4km/h / T 4:26h / left to go: 1556km

from Baja the road went alongside Duna through the national park all the way to Mohacs. on the road we took a lunch break down by the river. whiles we were eating a really cool snake swam by (a postcard for the one can determinate which species it is!). we also saw the White Tailed Eagle. in Ujmohacs we had to take a ferry to Mohacs, we realized that we hadn't accounted for it, luckily it only cost 680 Huf and we had 710 Huf left. the till girl tried to scam us but Hannah got help from a local who could some English.

In Mohacs we sat down in a Internet cafe and in a kebab restaurant during the worst heat. at the tourist information we were told that was an ATM on the Croatian side of the border. after this pause we went over to the Hvratska (Croatian) border. at the custom station (the first real one so far) there was a lot of commotion about Hannahs old Swedish residence permit. after about 20min we were finally aloud to pass. on the road to Batina we where keeping an eye out for an ATM, but because Batina was the "largest" town we where sure that we would find one there. when we got there we realized that there was either a shop nor an ATM in the village.

after one hour of searching we finally found a guest house on the "Green Island", the only one within a radius of 30km.  it is a  summer house by the Dunav  with a real nice owner. he explained that it wasn't any problem that we only had Serbian currency and showed us to our room. we where overjoyed that we had found somewhere to sleep and didn't have to camp in a minefield. we went for a swim in the Dunav and where offered air dried ham and home made olive oil by Hannes Kala, Austrian man, who also lived in the house. overwhelmed we went to bed.

## Batina to Vukovar

### 01.06.2008 / 100km / AS 18.0km / T 3:31 / left to go: 1472km

### HANNAH HAS LOST HER MOBILE!!! if you need to reach her send a SMS to Nisses phone: +46 731 53 90 05 (it works again!!)

in the morning we realized that we didn't have as much Serbian money as we thought we had. as red as two cherries by shame we handed over the Czech money that we had with us by mistake. luckily Hannes Kala vouched for us and promised to pay the rest. Hannah also got a pocket sunwatch as a gift from him. we had a really bad conscience   when we left.

we soon reached the national Park "Kopaci rit" and cycled on the river bank along the marsh. we saw wild boars, black and white stork, a lot of eagles, a fox, night- gray- and "white" heron and tons of other birds. after 10km the road became grass that messed up in the chain. after another 10km it suddenly changed to fist large rocks so we had to ride through the meadow. the marsh was incredible beautiful and reminded of the Niger Delta and we where always expecting to see an Elephant graze in the distance. after 40km we reached Bilje, were we had lunch and finally got some cash.

we just went through Osijek. on the way we saw a lot of blast damaged buildings and started to wonder about what the war was about. the only thing we could read in the book, was that it was a civil war back in the 90ies . from Osijek we went strait to Vukovar. on the way we saw many signs warning us of land mines alongside the road. in Vukovar, the most damaged city during the war, the mixture of totally blown up houses and the brand new glass buildings was is totally bizarre. Nisse got hubris and ecstasy at the same time and Hannah had to hold him back from not climbing in to the ruins. we found the cities only guest house pretty fast and went in to town to look at the bombed up houses. the water some of the most amazing things we have seen, you can't even imagine how it keeps itself erect. finally back in the hotel Hannah discovered, that she had forgotten her mobile in Batina. very embarrassing :-S can it become worse?

## Vukovar to Novi Sad

### 02.06.2008 / 90km / AS 17.9km/h / T 5:06h / left to go: 1394km

all the way to Ilok we cycled on a darkyellow road with red dots. after Opatovac we came into the hills, the map showed some hills, but the marks were never set in the correct spot. shoot the fucking intern that edited that map (more or less everything is wrong). we road on to Ilok were we looked at the town and ate a "Dunav-Plate" which was a big plate with a lot of meat of all different kinds.

after Ilok we passed the border to Serbia (got no stamp at the costoms this time, snif). after the border it went on up and down, up and down ... all the way to Cerevic. when we passed the town and looked like mashed potatoes a crazy kosovo Serb stopped us and asked us in for some coffee. he dad a strange maybe rabies contagioned dalmatiner that looked like a breed beween a goat and dog. the coffee was very good and Hannah had to smoke slim cigarettes and Nisse got 'KENT' (women cigarette and collegue cigarette).

we went on to Novi Sad on a very nasty road with a lot of trafic. when we arrived we where very tired in our legs and in our mind. In Novi Sad we took in at a little hostel. we decided to go to a restaurant were Nisse ordered a white wine to his Paella, but got a bad red wine instead. afte around half an hour of nagging he got a white even worse one. we hat to pay both. afterwards we went to an Internet caffee and blogged for 2,5h. now we finally found out about the war we had seen so many traces of. it wasn't a civil war as nit was written in the book bua anliberation war. at 01:00 we went to bed.

## Novi Sad to Fruska Gora

### 03.06.2008 /31km / AS 11.5km/h / T 2:42h / left to go: 1379km

after a lot of thinking and sking we decided to go up to the national park 'Fruska gora' (holy mountain) and from there to Belgrad. the alternative would have been to go on heavy traficated roads with a lot of lorries. before lunch we fixed a lot of things. tried to tke out some Euro an went to a bycycle store because Hannahs bike sounded strange. we also went up to the fortress Petrovaradin. it is 110 ha big and has tunnels of more than 16km.

before we started to climb the mountain we had very special lunch. the menue was only available in Kyrill and so we asked some guys and they picked for us. we got some kind of beef roulade that very much reminded of a breadcrumbed camels dick, and it didn't make it better, that it was filled with cheese.

on the way to Fruska gora we had to ask for the way some times, and every time it became a big gathering of people wanting to help us. the cycling/climbing was very hard. in ther first 30min we made at least 200m hight. we went on a small footpath and around the bends and when it got too steep we had to demount our bikes. all in all we made around 400 hm this day. when we arrived at the top we had to realise that the view was covered by trees. we decided to find a nice spot with a little better view and camp out in the wild. finnaly we also found what we where looking for. it was an amazing spot that has to be "lived" and not described.

## Fruska Gora to Belgrad

### 04.06.2008 / 29km /AS 18.9km/h / T 1:32h / left to go: 1128.5km

in the morning we wake up with a stunning view over the foothills of Fruska gora. we had no breakfast with us and the kichen stuff was soaked in dish liquid so we couldn't make any coffee. at 7:30 we started our biking. it mostly went downhill but we decided to take the train from Indija to Belgrad (50 km) because we where told that there was a traffic jam all the way into Belgrade.

after a very long discussion and several phone calls later we got the tickets for our bicycles. it cost us 300 Dinar for a bike and 100 Dinar per person. at 12 we arrived in Belgrad and went strait to a hostel near the station. the traffic in the city sceard us a little but we had to take Hannahs bike to reparation because it sounded like a jaybird. after a lot of searching and two tourist informations later, we had seen half of Belgrade and experienced the traffic, we finally found it. it was a hard task even for the experts to find out what was wrong. after a lot of testdriving they foud out that the main hub was loose. they fixed everything for free.

back in the hotel we dicided to go to town by foot once again but it started to thunder and rain so we stayed at a restaurant and went then back. now we are sitting and blogging in a small office in the hostel. the connection is miserable and its like 38 degrees in here. by now Nisse has gone to bed. he's no more use :-)
