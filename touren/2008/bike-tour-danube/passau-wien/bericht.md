## Passau to Kobling (nr.2)
  
### 10.05.2008 / 115km / AS 17.6km/h / Time 6:33h / left to go: 2987km

we had a cold breakfast, because the gastube was empty. the morning we spent in Passau going from shop to shop in order to restock. we got two new gastubes, raingear and new food. at noon we listened to an organ concert at the worlds largest church organ, in the Passauer dome. (Sebbe försök säga orgel i plural 10 ggr i rad!)

after the concert Nisse wanted a Kebab, when it was time to pay he couldn't find his wallet. ten heart attacs later Nisse went back into the restaurant and found it on the table. By two o cklock we managed to get away and after 25km we reached the German-Austrian border.

we continued on the southbank to Au (the first, not the second one, there we took the ferry down to Inzell. here the Donau squeezes in between the mountains and makes two 180 degree turns. the landscape is breathtakingly beautiful. when we got to Kobling (the second one, not the first one) we put up the tent. we had to install the new gastubes, last time it had worked quite easy, but this time the gaschamber wouldn't fit and we got butan gas all over, so Nisses shoes frose solid. we where lucky not to get frostbite. after this accident Hannah did a little thinking and had the brilliant idea, that you could take the burner off, before you install the gas.

## Kobling (nr.2) to Grein
  
### 20.05.2008 / 106km / AS 20.5km/h / T 5:10 / left to go: 2234.5km

5 min after we got on our bikes it started raining and it would continue untill the next morning. the road we took was alongside a heavy trafficated road and we got splashed down by every passing lorry. pissed off as hell we got to Linz where we dried ourself a little bit at a entrance of a mall. after lunch we continued through the rain towards Mauthausen. In Mauthausen we had the cracy idea to mount a hill in order to visit a KZ (concentration camp). we walked around in the rain for about two hours and freezing and wet we dicided to go the last 40km to Grein without any stops.

shortly after Mauthausen we met another group and could make rather good speed. But after 10km Hannahs tire blew and we had to stop to change the tube in the pouring rain. jet wetter and eaven angrier, we road on in a dreadful speed. Hannah was peddaling like a "snälltåg" and Nisse had problems keeping up, even though he wa sin the windshadow behind her. finally against all odds we made it to Grein.

## Grein to Krems
  
### 21.05.2008 / 92km / AS 19.4km/h / T 4:44h / left to go: 2142.5km

when we woke up it had stopped raining, but the rainclouds were still heavy. we went over to the right bank. our clothes were  exactly as damp as on the evening. the road to Ybbs was truely beautiful. in Ybbs we took a coffee and called Marlene and asked her if we could sleep at her parents place. we went on through Melk where we went over to the left side. the road was jammed with cycle tourists.

after Aggsbach we reached the Wachau valley, which is one of the most beautiful places this far. in one little village we bought a bottle of liquer from a little gandmother who makes it from her own orchard. we thought it was a perfect gift for Marlenes parents. half a kilometer away we had to stop again to visit the place where the Willendorf Venus was found. in this manner it kept going (or stopping) through out the valley.

the rain clouds where over our heads the entire day, but against all odds we stayed dry. Dürnstein was overrun by tourists so we passed trough and went dirctly to Krems, which also is a beautiful city. but unfortunatly tha camping is situated on the worst spot of the entire Wachau. in the evening we went into town to look for a "Heurigen" which wasn't as easy as we had thought. at last we found one and had a good glas of wine and a nice time.

## Krems to Klosterneuburg
  
### 22.05.2008 / 73km / AS 19.9km/h / T 3:39h / left to go: 2068.5

in the morning we changed the brakes on Hannahs bike which was absolutely necessary because they were totally worn down and had started to grind down the rims. we realise that we MUST take better care of our bikes and not blindly  believe that they will be OK. after repairing the bikes we road in direction for Wien. we passed over to the south side over a large hydroelectric power plant. on the other side we saw an abandoned  nuclear power plant that never went into service.

When we reached Tulln we decided to by some groceries but to our surprise everything was closed. we asked some people and found out that it was a holiday in Austria. "Fronleichnam". so we had to go on to Klosterneuburg. we took in at the at the finest establishment in town: Marlenes parents Michael and Christina Muerwald. we took it easy in the afternoon and enjoyed not having to worry about our things. it was wonderful to drink some bears on their porch. when we arrived the sauna was already heated. in the evening we took the car up to the Heurigen. it was wonderful to sleep in a real bed in a real home.

## Wien
  
### 23.05.2008 / 0km / AS 0km/h / T 0:00h / left to go: 2068.5km

Hannah went up at 6:00h and went on a jogging tour with Michael. then Nisse went up and after a relaxed breakfast we took the train to Wien. from Schwedenplatz we where swept by the tourist stream towards the Stephans Dom. in the Dom they were having holy mass, but it couldn't be so nice because of all the tourists photographing. we walked around the inner city for about two hours and saw a lot of pompous bragging buildings. at Michaelerplatz we enjoyed some true architecture of Adolf Loos. then we took another turn in the city looking for a Kaiserschmarren.

after the Kaiserschmarren we took the metro to Schloss Schoenbrunn, where we once again were swept along by the tourist-tsunami. we managed to find a way through the huge garden without meeting too many tourists. the barrock park is capable of taking eternal amount of tourists. we ate dinner with our host and Micheals relatives.  we got a splendid asparagus-risotto salad and a lot of wine. we would have liked to stay another week. it was truelzy wonderfull and Michael and Christina were excellent hosts.
