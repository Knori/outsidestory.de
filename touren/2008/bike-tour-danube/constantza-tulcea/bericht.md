## Constantza

### 17.06.1008 | 0km | left to go: 134km

in the morning the adventure started with the bus trip in to Constantza. it took us halv an hour to understand were the bus station was, because there are no signs. in town we managed to take a bus to the train station. they have the weirdest ticket system here, with individual hole markings for each bus. at the station we bought two tickets from Tulcea to Bukarest for the 21st of June. then bus nr. 43 in to the center again, two stations too far (there is no chance to see out of the bus). we asked two guys for an Internetcafe and they took us on another bus back to the point where we started this morning.

at the Internetcafe we searched for a flight home for Nisse, but didn't find any. so we took bus nr. 42 in to town again, one bus stop to far, and walked the to the EuroLines bus ticket office. there Hannah bought here ticket home. Bus from Bukarest to Zuerich, the 25th, 30 hours, 103 Euro. on the way to another Internetcafe, that we never found, we ate some Mamaliga in a restaurant. we gave up the busses and walked to the trainstation again to change our ticket for Bukarest to the 24th of June. a little embarrasing. when we where finished we took bus nr. 40 to Mamaia. we got off 8 stations too early and had to walk to the next minibus "station". we jumped on the first bus we saw, but unfortunatly it stopped far too soon., so we had to walk the last 4km to the camping. back at the camping we enjoyed the last sun and took another bath in the Black Sea and ah... Nisse has still no ticket home.

## Constantza day 2

### 18.06.2008 | 0km | left to go: 134km 

in the morning we tookyhe bus into Constatza again. this time we had better luck and got on a big bus. Constantza was founded by the ancient greeks under the name Tomis. the roman emperor Constantin renamed it later. at our starting point in the city we first visited the Internetcafe again. Hannah blogged and Nisse looked for a flight home. finally he found one on the 25th from Bukarest over Ljubliana.

we followed the b.-Dul Tomis in to the center. first we saw a statue of Remus and Romulus, looked at the archelogic museum and went into the mosaic museum. in the 60ies they found a very big roman floor mosaic in Constantza. after all the culture around Piata Ovidiu (Ovid lived and died in Constantza) we had some lunch at a fast food restaurant again. it was exactly as untasty as last time.

after lunch we visited the Moscue. it is the biggest in Romania. we could also go up on the minaret and have a look at the city from above. here in the old town a lot of special buildings lie very close to each other so we looked at a small rather modern Basilica completely in bricks and without any decoration. The big orthodox cathedral "Sf. Petu si Pavel" on the otherhand is full of fresques and reliques. luckily I hadn't my periode so i was allowed to go in. we got a short guidance from the shop owner and bought an info broscure.

after a walk down at pier we went to the old Casino, a clissic building from 1910. it is shut down and being renovated but for 10 Lei each we where allowed to enter for 5min. the interior is amazing and the athmosphere of the empty Casino has to be experienced. take a look at the photos. overjoyed we took a coffee, bought some groceries and took the buses back to the camping. this time we managed it without walking. in the night a thunderstorm came over us and there where lightnings and thunder for over two hours.

## Constantza to Jurilovca

### 19.06.2008 | 98km | AS 20.6km/h | T 4:45 | left to go: 54km

in the morning it felt quite strange to be on the road again, but it went very well. the road was heavily trafficated and went through some petro chemical industries. shortly before Istria we made a detour out to the ruins of Cetatea Histria. on the road out there we found a turtle, which we saved. when we got to Histria we realised that we had to pay 12 Lei to get into the ruins. we skipped that, took a coffee and cycled the seven kilometers back to the main road. In Istria we ate lunch at a Magazin Mixt. we cycled down to the yellow road, passed Baia and the Kolchoses (big farming industies from the Sovjet era). then off to Jurilovca.

we had just passed village Lunca when the rain started. we cycled through the pouring rain all the way to Jurilovca. wet from top to bottom we entered the village. the road went down and over a little stream, at the bottom there where a lot of water filled holes. Hannah was unlucky and hit the deepest one. the front wheel crashed into the hole and the saddle came flying into her back. we sprained wrist and a surface wound on her back we continued. soon we found a turist Information where they helped us finding a nice little pension. after we showered and dried off we went searching for a restaurant. we found the only restaurant in Jurilovca. we had very low expectations because it looked like a mixture of a village disco and a russian dining hall. against all fears the food was excellent and we went to bed pleased and with full stomaches but quite sore.

## Jurilovca to Tulcea

### 20.06.2008 | 66km | AS 15.9km/h | T 4:23 | left to go: 0km :-D

In the morning Hannah was still in a lot of pain in the right side, so we took it quite easy. the road between Salcioara and Enisala went through stunningly beautiful landscape but the asphalt was in terrible condition. the holes where several meters in diameter and it was easier to cycle between the asphalt than on it. it went almost slower downhill than uphill. in Enisala we where in such a hurry to get away from the rain that we took the wrong turn and got on the road to Babadag instead. as soon as we discovered it we turned back to Enisala. there we took a break and because Hannah was still not better we where thinking of hitching a ride with a lorry or rent a donkey carriage. but we decided to tough it out and cycled on with headwind, mud and uphills but finally we reached Tulcea.

once we went searching for tourist information but course there was none to be found. we went down to the marina in search of a night quarter. we where stopped by a tourist agent and whiles he tried to convince us of a thousand things at once, the swiss couple, that we met shortly after Bukarest, showed up. we had left them in Rackeve, because they went over Transylvania to Tulcea. we where so happy that we met again and we decided to stay two nights in the same hotel and to join them on a boat trip through the delta to Sulina the next day. whiles we where showering they arranged a boat trip. fore supper we all had some Mamaliga in a restaurant down by the marina.

## Tulcea to Sulina to Tulcea

### 21.06.2008 | about 60km with the boat | AS: 15knot | reached point 0km :-P

after our first breakfast buffet on the entire trip, we ate until our belly buttons popped out, we went down to the marina and Simon, our our captain, was already waiting for us. first we went made some turns through the deltas smaller channels. there we saw insane amount of birds, endless versions of long legged birds, hole swarms of pelican, one flamingo, great cormorant, and many more. the area is astishingly beautiful with oile trees dippeng their branches into the water. ones we we came close a very big flock of great cormorant that went up in the sky. we took a short coffee break in Sulina and then continued through the main channel towards the open sea. the feeling of finally reaching our goal, the open sea, once again was overwhelming. 

on the way back we had an amazing picknick on the boat with bread, cheese and vegetables together with Steff and Sumi. after about 8 hours on the boat, we where back in Tulcea. after we dumped our stuff at the hotel, we had some icecream at a pizzeria and tried to find some postcards, sadly we did not have any success with that. for dinner we decided to all go to a burger restaurant. w really saw forward for the healthy meal with meat and vegies, but the meat was really grose. it tasted like something between an old ram and a roadkill. in German one would say Hammelburger. the burger where really disgusting and we could not stop talking about roadkills so only Nise and Steff managed to finish them.

## Tulcea to Dunavatzu de Sus 

### 22.06.2008 | 36km | AS 15.1km/h | T 2:23 

before we checked out from the hotel we filled our stomaches with some breakfast buffet. we had decided to make a little cycle tour in the area of the delta for two days together with Steff and Sumi. They had planned to continue down to Constantza from where they would have their plane back. we took it very easy, ate some weird berries and ended up in Murighiol at some point. we had some insider information about an amazing camping. we searched for this camping for about an hour, so we continued to the next village. the road was already gravel and we also could not find anything here, so we sat down in a little bar and ordered some biera fara alcohol. 

we ended up sitting in the garden and order one drink after the other playing cards for a few hours. after some time the waitres/owner came and served us some free smoked eel and bread. in the evening we decided to stay over night, we where allowed to put up our tents in the horse paddock and to use the bathrooms of the pension under construction that was next to the bar. the owener was incredible, she made us another amazing fish and sallad for dinner that we of course paid with a lot of tips. In the horse paddock was a mare with a foal. first we thought the mare was dead, because she lay down as if so, but later in the evening they bozh bacame more alert.

## Dunavatzu de Sus to Tulcea

### 23.06.2008 | 55km | AS 17.1km/h | T 3:11 

in the morning we had a calm and big breakfast from food from the Magasin Mixt at the bar. at 10 o'clock it became way too hot to sit still so we mounted our bikes and staded to ride back on the bumpy road. istaed of rideng the short way back to Tulcea, we followed Steff and Sumi to Agighiol and from there we took the sme way back to Tulcea as we had taken a few days earlier. the trip was really beautiful and mostly car free. It was a great experience to meet Steff and Sumi twice and we where a little bit sad that we had to part our ways. 

We rode back the last 17km with some nostalgia, it was a strange feeling to ride the same disatance twice. in Tulcea we found a small pension for 66 Lei, printed out some photos in a shop and wrote, fixed and so on. it was way too hot in the room and we almost melted while repacking our stuff for the trip back.

## Tulcea to Bukkaresti

### 24.06.2008 | 55km with the train 

in the morning we still had to do a lot. we fixed our bikes, bought letter covers, packed, bought food and waited for a long time at the train station. while we ae waiting there , suddenly the other, old, swiss couple comes along, those we met first time after Belgrade. The train took us first south, more or less where we had cycled north, almost to Constantza. the train was airconditioned and very clean and we whre very happy we had waited for thisone because it was about 38 degrees outside.

finlally in Bukkaresti we had a lot of problems finding the EuroLines bus station without a map of the city. we tried in all bookshops at the main station and slso searched like crazy for some kind of turist information, but couldn't find anything. but finnly we managed. we went back to the station trying to find a tourist information, but they just do not exist in Romania. at the end we found ourselfs a human guide who showed us to an Internet café and a grocery store. we wehre discussing al lot together about the bible and faith and other things. he told us basicly his whole life story. after he had shown us we paid him a way ti big summe for his guiding in the city. Nisse went to his hotel and a went back to the bus station because my bus was supposed to leave at 4am.
