### Turnu Magurele to Vedea
  
### 12.06.2008 / 108km / AS 23.3km/h / T 5:17 / left to go: 452km

in the morning Uwe told us that he will join the Germans because they also have to each a hotel every night. we where very sad to loose Uwe, but we can understand him very well. we bought our luch sandwiches, looked at the spiral towers uf the church and then went off to our favorite road again. shortly before Zimnicea we had a really good downhill and we made such good speed that Nisse accidently drove over a one meter long snake.

In Zimnicea we bought vegetables at a marked and had a steady luch. it was very hot outside and there was no Internetcafe so we sat down in the hotel cafe indstead. at 3pm we went on again. in Pietrosani we left the country road and biked on the dam instead to look for somewere to camp. after 10km we found a traktor trail which we thought was going down to the Dunarea. It was 2km long and in a very bad state. when we reached Dunarea it was in a really ugly place, where you couldn't bath. soon the thunder started roaring and it looked very much like rain so we decided to go back to the dam and head forward to get closer to the main road. we made quite good speed because we had the thunderstorm and the wind in our backs. after a while we found a place down by the river were we could put up our tent. our tent had ben packed whet so it smelled like an old washrag mixed with corpse.

### Vedea to Roja Hotel (Nova Cherna)

### 13.06.2008 / 86km / AS 19.8km/h / T 4:20h / left to go: 381km

when we got up on the dam a car stopped and two men got out. they where talking about the border police and told to whait. here the Dunarea is the border to Bulgaria. afte a while the police showed up and wanted to see our passports. the police officer was very nice so we did't get that worried. after explaing our intentions and our route they let us continue. when we reached the main road again, the police was whaiting for us and and soon one of the officers came back whith some lunch for us.

In Giurgiu Nisse wanted to get into an abandoned industrial and residetial area, but we where promptly told to leave. after 3 hour brake the central of Giurgiu we headed for the border. the Bridge was built in the 50ies and is the only bridge over Dunarea between Romania and Bulgaria. after the border crossing, which went very smothly, Nisse started  ti feel a little ill . we decided to  try the "road" down by the river but it mostly mud. afterlunch we headed back to the highway towards Silistra. our goal for the day was to reach Tutrakan but we stopped at a roadside hotel 10km before. the road was magniextraordinary boring. Nisse was getting a diarreha and Hannah was hard as rock in the stomach. we almost regreted going over to Bulgaria. what a crap country.

### Roja Hotel (Nova Charna) to Silistra

### 14.06.1008 / 83km / AS 17.2km/h / T 4:49h / left to go: 278km

in the morning Hannah was still hard in the stomach and Nisse felt bad again. we took a coffee at the hotel and took turns in running to the toilett. as we left we where attacked by two gurad dogs who tried to bite Hannah in the leg. In Tutrakan we stopped because Nisse had to shit. at the next gas station we had to stopp again, because Nisse had to go to the toilett, and so it went on untill evening.

we decided to leave the main road and cycle alongside the Dunarea instead. it was a little risky because the path was marked as very bad and it had rained during the night. we never regretted our desicion because the landscape was amazingly beautiful and the small villages very nice. it went a lot up and down but we always had a lot of fun in the downhills. one of the steeper down hills went through a forest and it was very muddy. Hannah was very careful but Nisse thought it be no meaning in breaking. shortly after fell the first time and broke off his back mirror.

### Silistra to Crangu

### 15.06.2008 / 62km / AS 17.6km/h / T 3:31h / left to go: 220km

in the morning Nisse still was very ill in the stomach. first we crossed the border back to Romania. shortly after the border we met a huge group of tandem cycling frenchmen. the road went a lot up and down again and mostly it was cobble stone pavement. at the monastery Dervent in Galita we took a short pause. we talked to girl from Bukarest who told us we should try to eat Mamaliga, a special Romanian dish. unfortunatly we couln't go into the church because there where way too many people in it.

the road went on innerver ending ups and downs. Nisse just became worse, so Hannah had to pull in front the whole day. In Baneasa we took lunch. there we met the frenchmen again. they wanted to continue all the way to Constante today. shortly after Baneasa we had to stop and look for somewere to camp, becuase Nisse was unable to cycle anymore and had to go ad take a crap every fith minute. we found a nice and secluded place on the hill. Nisse went to bed directly after supper.

Hannah stayed awake for a few hours more. it was only 5pm. She listened to audio books and explored the surrounding which consisted of a rhy field.it was not very exiting but Nisse in the tent smelled so strongly of amoniac and sweat that it almost was impossible to go in there.

### Crangu to Canstanta

### 16.06.2008 / 99km / AS 19.2km/h /T 5:09h / left to go: 134km

Hannah went up in the morning and fixed everything. Nisse just went up for show, but in real he still slept while we left. after a few kolometers we came to the remains of the roman fortress city Tropeaum Traiani in Adamclisi. there Nisse woke up a little and we had a lot of fun exploring the ruins and the all the snakes and other small animals. we had the whole ruin for ourselfs, it was only 9am, so no turists!

after Adamclisi it continued up and down the whole way to Constanta. Hannah had always to whait at the top of the hills for Nisse. the only words that came from Nisse this day where: "47, 46, 45... i don't get that it is only 45km left!" before the big road to Constanta we ate an early lunch on the road side and wached the horse and donkey carriages. in more and more heavy traffic we road on to Constanta and the Black Sea. as we saw the first blue glimpses our eyes filled withe tears. this feeling is undescibable, you have to ride the bike all the way from Zuerich to understand.

after a short trip down at the sea we started to search for a turist information center. after about 3 hours we gave up, because all seem to have shut down or the wrong adress. as we sat in a restaurant and all hpe was gone the frenchmen showed up and told us that there are a lot of campings north of Mamaia, a beach and hotel area. we took our bikes uot there and found the best camping ever, next to the Black Sea, there we also took our first bath. niiiice!

### Constanta

### 17.06.1008 / 0km / left to go: 134km

in the morning the adventure started with the bus trip in to Constanta. it took us halv an hour to understand were the bus station was, because there are no signs. in town we managed to take a bus to the train station. they have the weirdest ticket system here, with individual hole markings for each bus. at the station we bought two tickets from Tulcea to Bukarest for the 21st of June. then bus nr. 43 in to the center again, two stations too far (there is no chance to see out of the bus). we asked two guys for an Internetcafe and they took us on another bus back to the point where we started this morning.

at the Internetcafe we searched for a flight home for Nisse, but didn't find any. so we took bus nr. 42 in to town again, one bus stop to far, and walked the to the EuroLines bus ticket office. there Hannah bought here ticket home. Bus from Bukarest to Zuerich, the 25th, 30 hours, 103 Euro. on the way to another Internetcafe, that we never found, we ate some Mamaliga in a restaurant. we gave up the busses and walked to the trainstation again to change our ticket for Bukarest to the 24th of June. a little embarrasing. when we where finished we took bus nr. 40 to Mamaia. we got off 8 stations too early and had to walk to the next minibus "station". we jumped on the first bus we saw, but unfortunatly it stopped far too soon., so we had to walk the last 4km to the camping. back at the camping we enjoyed the last sun and took another bath in the Black Sea and ah... Nisse has still no ticket home.

### Constanta day 2

### 18.06.2008 / 0km / left to go: 134km 

in the morning we tookyhe bus into Constatza again. this time we had better luck and got on a big bus. Constantza was founded by the ancient greeks under the name Tomis. the roman emperor Constantin renamed it later. at our starting point in the city we first visited the Internetcafe again. Hannah blogged and Nisse looked for a flight home. finally he found one on the 25th from Bukarest over Ljubliana.

we followed the b.-Dul Tomis in to the center. first we saw a statue of Remus and Romulus, looked at the archelogic museum and went into the mosaic museum. in the 60ies they found a very big roman floor mosaic in Constanta. after all the culture around Piata Ovidiu (Ovid lived and died in Constanta) we had some lunch at a fast food restaurant again. it was exactly as untasty as last time.

after lunch we visited the Moscue. it is the biggest in Romania. we could also go up on the minaret and have a look at the city from above. here in the old town a lot of special buildings lie very close to each other so we looked at a small rather modern Basilica completely in bricks and without any decoration. The big orthodox cathedral "Sf. Petu si Pavel" on the otherhand is full of fresques and reliques. luckily I hadn't my periode so i was allowed to go in. we got a short guidance from the shop owner and bought an info broscure.

after a walk down at pier we went to the old Casino, a clissic building from 1910. it is shut down and being renovated but for 10 Lei each we where allowed to enter for 5min. the interior is amazing and the athmosphere of the empty Casino has to be experienced. take a look at the photos. overjoyed we took a coffee, bought some groceries and took the buses back to the camping. this time we managed it without walking. in the night a thunderstorm came over us and there where lightnings and thunder for over two hours.

### Constanta to Jurilovca

### 19.06.2008 / 98km / AS 20.6km/h / T 4:45h / left to go: 54km

in the morning it felt quite strange to be on the road again, but it went very well. the road was heavily trafficated and went through some petro chemical industries. shortly before Istria we made a detour out to the ruins of Cetatea Histria. on the road out there we found a turtle, which we saved. when we got to Histria we realised that we had to pay 12 Lei to get into the ruins. we skipped that, took a coffee and cycled the seven kilometers back to the main road. In Istria we ate lunch at a Magazin Mixt. we cycled down to the yellow road, passed Baia and the Kolchoses (big farming industies from the Sovjet era). then off to Jurilovca.

we had just passed village Lunca when the rain started. we cycled through the pouring rain all the way to Jurilovca. wet from top to bottom we entered the village. the road went down and over a little stream, at the bottom there where a lot of water filled holes. Hannah was unlucky and hit the deepest one. the front wheel crashed into the hole and the saddle came flying into her back. we sprained wrist and a surface wound on her back we continued. soon we found a turist Information where they helped us finding a nice little pension. after we showered and dried off we went searching for a restaurant. we found the only restaurant in Jurilovca. we had very low expectations because it looked like a mixture of a village disco and a russian dining hall. against all fears the food was excellent and we went to bed pleased and with full stomaches but quite sore.

### Jurilovca to Tulcea

### 20.06.2008 / 66km / AS 15.9km/h / T 4:23h / left to go: 0km :-D

In the morning Hannah was still in a lot of pain in the right side, so we took it quite easy. the road between Salcioara and Enisala went through stunningly beautiful landscape but the asphalt was in terrible condition. the holes where several meters in diameter and it was easier to cycle between the asphalt than on it. it went almost slower downhill than uphill. in Enisala we where in such a hurry to get away from the rain that we took the wrong turn and got on the road to Babadag instead. as soon as we discovered it we turned back to Enisala. there we took a break and because Hannah was still not better we where thinking of hitching a ride with a lorry or rent a donkey carriage. but we decided to tough it out and cycled on with headwind, mud and uphills but finally we reached Tulcea.

once we went searching for tourist information but course there was none to be found. we went down to the marina in search of a night quarter. we where stopped by a tourist agent and whiles he tried to convince us of a thousand things at once, the swiss couple, that we met shortly after Bukarest, showed up. we had left them in Rackeve, because they went over Transylvania to Tulcea. we where so happy that we met again and we decided to stay two nights in the same hotel and to join them on a boat trip through the delta to Sulina the next day. whiles we where showering they arranged a boat trip. fore supper we all had some Mamaliga in a restaurant down by the marina.

### Tulcea to Sulina to Tulcea

### 21.06.2008 / boat a lot of km / AS: 15knot / reached point 0km :-P

after our first breakfast buffet on the entire trip, we ate until our belly buttons popped out. at 8am we went down to the marina ans Simon our our captain was waiting for us. first we went out to the through the delta on the smaller channels. there we saw insane amount of birds, endless versions of long legged birds, hole swarms of pelican, one flamingo, great cormorant, ... will be continued... :-D
