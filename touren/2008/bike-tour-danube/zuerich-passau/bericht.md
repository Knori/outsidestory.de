## Zürich Altstetten to Donaueschingen
    
### 10.05.2008 | 115km | AS 17.6km/h | Time 6:33h | left to go: 2987km

we started quiet easy through Zürich towards the airport. in Glattbrugg we followed the river Glatt on a amazing cycle path all the way to the Rhein. It was mostly downhill, so we got a little euphoric about how easy it was. we ate lunch by the Rhein and then followed the river upstreams to Schaffhausen. we had to do a 110 hight meter on 4 km and thought that was hard, but we had no idea of what was coming.

in Schaffhausen we visited the Rheinfall. it was definitly worth it. after these 70km it started to get tuff. it was steep upphill and the sun burned our backs. when we came to the Swiss-German border the joy of finally getting downhill was overtaken by the force of the headwind. after 6 1/2 h on the charmoin and 11h on the road, we came to the Donaueschingen Camping. We where stunned that it was possible to ride our bikes over 115 km and still no pain, just tired.

## Donaueschingen to Probstfelsen (Beuron)

### 11.05.2008 | 70km | AS 18.0km/h | Time: 3:53h | left to go: 2928km

after breakfast we cycled back to Donaueschingen and visited the spring and the barock castle. now the journey started for real alongside the Donau, which barely could be called a stream. to our surprise it bacme smaller and smaller the further down we came, because it went down in underground tunnels. after Tuttlingen the Donau squized itself through mighty chalk cliff. it was absolutly amazing and we had to stop and take fotos at every bend. after Fridingen all the civilization dissappeard and it was just us, the railway and the mighty cliffs, the forest and of course the Donau.

we saw a camping on the other side of the river and decided to stop there. we had to wade across the river. it was exactly so shallow, so we did not get wet.on the the other side we where told, that it was not allowed to camp there. so we had to wade back again. a little bit smarter and a lot wetter we asked in the restaurant "Jagerhof" where we could camp. our camping was on field we a spectacular view of the cliffs. Nisse fell asleep at 7pm to the soud of a small thunderstorm.

## Probstfelsen to Munderkingen

### 12.05.2008 | 97km | AS 18.2km/h | T 5:19h | left to go: 2835km

in the morning the fog thick as pudding and when the the sun came out at 7am it faded away and gave way for the splendid view. Hannah took a morning bath in the river and the we startded our day. we cycled through the valley towards Inzigkofen, it was so beautifull, so that we had problems staying on the road. at Inzigkofen we took a walk through a 17th century park. then we road to Sigmaringen. here was one of the coolest castles we had ever been to. from outside it looks like a collage and inside every room has its own style and function. the armoury the Europes biggest private collection of wapons was the highlight. The Hohenzollern dynasty had set a significant mark in european history. the guides german was so good, that even Nisse could understand it without translation.

in Riedlingen we went swimming in the Donau. it was could but very refreshing. in Munderkingen, our final station this day, we where alone on the camping. at a pub in the town we met two "störtsköna lirare" hwo thought we were huligans, cycling with a average speed of 18km/h. "Heja Ulli & Julian!"

## Munderkingen to Günzburg

### 13.05.2008 | 80km | AS 19.2km/h | T 4:10h | left to go: 2765km

up at 6am we road to Ehingen where we bougt some breakfast at Aldi at ate something at the market place. then we went straight through for 40km to Ulm. here the river Iller joined the Donau. in Ulm we visited the Münster which has the tallest church tower in the world: 161m. after 742 steps we could enjoy a great view over Ulm and the Donau. we ate lunch in a picturesque little restaurant in the fishing and tanner quarter. we could see the food swim by in the river Blau.

from Ulm we continued only to Günzburg because we had spent a lot of time viewing the city. In Günzburg we had some problems (Nisse more than Hannah "Jävla skithåla") finding the caming. Nisse got no warm water in the shower, at the toilett no water at all. after showering we cycled back to town looking for a internet cafe. we walket up and down the mainstreet following directions for two hours untill we foud out, that the internet cafe had become a kebab. "hata Günzburg!"

## Günzburg to Neuburg a.d. Donau

### 14.05.2008 | AS 19.5km/h | T 5:36h | left to go: 2660km

we had already planned to go lots of km yeasterday, but visiting Ulm took long time, so this is the kilometer-day. the road went back and forth through Germanay but almost never alongside the river. we cycled through Gulfingen, Launingen and Dillingen. in Faimingen we took a short brake and looked at a roman temple at eleven o clock we took an early lunch and by then we had already made 40km. we went through open landscapes the gazing sun above us. in Donauwürth we ate a 2nd lunch and finally found an internet cafe and could blogg. after these 70 km we had another 35 km to go. now we went up and down the hills for two hours. we didn't bother with the sights , we just wnted to get to Neuburg. our campingplace was in the middle of town.

## Neuburg a.d. Donau to Kelheim

### 15.05.2008 | 83km | AS 19.4km/h | T 4:17 | left to go: 2582km

we started by visiting the residential castle with its chapel that was haunted by ghosts (or maybe pidgeons). then we road on a 6km long, totally straight road to the hunting castle. then we went on to Ingolstadt (Frankenstein monster) where saw two very impressive churches. the first was from the "Spätgotik" were every chapel was unik. the other was "the" rokoko church in Bayern, with frescos covering all the walls and the cieling. Nisse thought that the relics were very interesting, Hannah on the other side will dream nightmares about them.

at 14h we had only made 24km so we had to speed on. we hoped we  could  ride alongside the donau for once, but the road was closed and we had to cycle through an industrial area. this was the first time on this journey Hannah got irritated. after Neustadt we came through big hops plantage, beautiful, but we had a really bad headwind. In Weltenburg we took the boat downstreams to Kelheim. this is the most norrow part of the Donaube. 20m deep and 70 m wide. to the right and left there were steep chalk cliffs. the tour was definitly worth it, not only because of the scenery, but also because the option was to ride up and down a mountain on a heavy trafficated road. In Kelheim we took in on a internetcafe, ate something, blogged and had some bears.

## Kelheim to Regensburg

### 16.05.2008 | 30km | AS ?km/h | T ?h | left to go 2545km

we woke up at the farm where we camped. Nisse was very happy, that he could by some fresh cowmilk directly from the tank. the day before we had talked about milking some sheep or by some fresh milk. after breakfast we started on our short (30km) trip to Regensburg. it was a nice morning tour alongside the Donau. In Regnsburg we found an Youth Hostel for 20€. we spent the day in Regensburg wandering around and looking at some more churches. we found some nice graves under one of the churches where the resurrection of the corpses inside was proclaimed. Goethe wrote: "In Regensburg steht Kirche an Kirche". after sone hours all the churches, graves, deadskulls and rokoko decoration just became to much and we went back to the Youth Hostel to make some simple washing, drying and repacking our things.

for dinner we had "Knödel und Schweinebraten" Hannah could just eat one Knödel while Nisse ate three and fell into "Knödelkoma". On the eavning ou bike computer broke. no chance to make it work again. Hannah was really angry on herself but still glad, that she had written everything down.

## Regensburg to Kleinschwarzach (Deggendorf)

### 17.05.2008 | 90km | AS 21.4km/h | T 4:14 | left to go: 2462km

we ate a steady breakfast at the Youth Hostel and then went looking for a bikestore in the city. we found one but had to wate a little time until somebody with a key came to open it. there Hannah bought a new bike-computer. it took a while to install it on the bike and so we came away from Regensburg first at 10:30h. on our way to Straubing we had a really good road, backwind and good but not to bad weather so we could speed up. we made it to Straubing (54km) in two and a half hours. In Straubing we bought some food (belive it is Sunday tomorrow?) and had some lunch. the city has a long market place, some city towers-it looks more or less like the last 20 cities we have been in, just a little bigger. In the St. Jacobs Dom, a barock church, we  could see a window designed by Albrecht Dürer.

after Starubing we road towards Deggendorf untill a small farm 5km before the city. there we could camp on a lane. this day the cyclepath went almost alongside the Donau. Hannah is very happy.

## Kleinschwarzach to Passau

### 18.05.2008 | AS 20,2km/h | T 3.23h | left to go:

when we woke up this morning the rain was ponding on our tent. we had our breakfast in the tent and had to force us to start cycling out in the rain. we had dressed us in raingear all over, just our feet became wet in some seconds. but thats life, just get through it! after a longer part on a gravel path our bikes were covered with mud and the chain sounded like it could brake every moment. In a little village we took in at a cafe and asked them if we could borrow their hosepipe. the old lady at the place was really worried about our feet and insisted that we should put on dry socks and some plastic bags. really good idea!. after a can of coffee we went on to Passau. this time we avoided all gravel paths by taking the main road.

in Passau Hannah was rather tired and dizzy in strange way so we took it easy, rested a little at the camping and then went in to town to stroll around, eat something real and blogg. Nisse got a little tired on wrighting so he is drinking Irish coffee and Hannah sits at the internet.
